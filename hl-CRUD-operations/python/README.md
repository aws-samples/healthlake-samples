# Sample Python code for Amazon HealthLake CRUD Operations.

## Prerequisites:
- Install the required Python packages. "`pip3 install requirements.txt`"
- Configure AWS Access Key and Secret Access Key either by exporting the values of "`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`" and "`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`" or by using "aws configure".

## Notes:
- Sample input files for POST and PUT operation code are available in "`hl-CRUD-operations/Sample-Input-Files/`" folder
- When in doubt, use the "`-h`" or "`--help`" option available in each of these Python scripts to understand the required inputs and the order in which they are expected. For example: "`python3 hl_boto_post.py -h`"
